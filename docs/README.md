# Documentation and resume checkpoint

This file is the authoritative entry point for a new agent or work session. Do not infer current work from the changelog.

## Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `0.31.0` |
| Parent release | `0.30.0` (bounded research metadata) |
| Current state | Stage 8C in progress: Strategy Lab evidence hierarchy productised |
| Verification | `193 passed` plus headless Playwright workflow checks |
| Completed | Stage 8A state foundation; Stage 8B visual system and Today command centre |
| Next product work | Continue Stage 8C with durable Data Management job presentation, then Macro ADR 0006 presentation |
| Parked research | Stage 9A: acceptance standard and candidate priority; then 9B locked experiment |
| Parked operations | Stage 10 cron; Stage 11 deployment |

The application has the Stage 8B Today command centre plus Stage 8C improvements to Symbol Research, refresh/watchlist recovery, research metadata, and Strategy Lab. Version 0.31.0 separates each strategy’s definition/configuration/evidence boundary from the temporary descriptive scoreboard: only CTA v1 carries its locked rejected decision and artifact, while prototypes are `not evaluable`. Session calculations expose not-run/running/complete/partial-failure states and refuse an empty selection instead of silently substituting the default basket. These calculations are not durable experiments and cannot revise documented evidence. Preserve the bounded metadata model and shared manual/scheduled pipeline contract.

Heavy statistical work is intentionally paused. On resumption, first operationalize candidate theses, audit benchmark/universe suitability, and only then apply the model acceptance scorecard. Read the protocol, CTA result, audit, and backlog before experiment design. Do not tune CTA v1 after observing its rejection.

## Non-negotiable state

- Product purpose: decide `reject`, `revise`, or `continue research`; never imply validated profit.
- Default project benchmark: Passive ETF-12 v1; every new protocol audits suitability; SPY and cash remain references.
- CTA v1: rejected under its locked protocol; this does not reject trend following generally.
- Execution: signal on completed close `N`, fill at next available open `N+1`.
- Watchlists: user-selected symbols persist per strategy and show lifecycle state.
- Candidate tabs: full-universe new-entry candidates per model, plus intersections; they are not watchlists.
- Data refresh and strategy runs are explicit actions, not navigation side effects.
- Macro series are non-tradable context under [ADR 0006](adr/0006-macro-data-contract.md); they never generate candidates until point-in-time data and a preregistered hypothesis exist.
- Cron, paper/live trading, brokers, and AWS remain out of scope.

## Resume sequence

1. Confirm `git status`, current version, and tests.
2. Read this checkpoint, then [product identity](identity.md), then the document for the active stage.
3. Preserve locked contracts unless creating a versioned ADR/protocol amendment.
4. Implement one bounded stage slice; update tests, roadmap, checkpoint, and changelog together.
5. Record research evidence as immutable results, not rewritten narrative.
