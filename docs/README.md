# Documentation and resume checkpoint

This file is the authoritative entry point for a new agent or work session. Do not infer current work from the changelog.

## Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `0.35.0` |
| Parent release | `0.34.0` (Stage 8C gate closure) |
| Current state | Stage 8D in progress: dependency/fingerprint preflight complete; executor pending |
| Verification | `202 passed` plus headless Playwright preflight check |
| Completed | Stage 8A state foundation; Stage 8B visual system and Today command centre |
| Next product work | Stage 8D: persist pipeline runs and execute the reviewed plan with dependency waits and failure-only retry |
| Parked research | Stage 9A: acceptance standard and candidate priority; then 9B locked experiment |
| Parked operations | Stage 10 cron; Stage 11 deployment |

Stage 8C is complete. Version 0.35.0 begins Stage 8D with a deterministic, read-only pipeline preflight. Explicit snapshots now store a SHA-256 fingerprint over strategy ID/version, parameters, scope, selected symbols, dataset IDs, row counts, and latest stored dates. The planner reports `refresh_required`, `blocked_data`, `ready`, `skipped_current`, and `skipped_empty` and is visible on Today only after an explicit preview click. It performs no refresh or model work. Next, a durable executor must consume this exact plan, wait for dependencies, persist outcomes, and retry only failed work. Cron remains parked.

Heavy statistical work is intentionally paused. On resumption, first operationalize candidate theses, audit benchmark/universe suitability, and only then apply the model acceptance scorecard. Read the protocol, CTA result, audit, and backlog before experiment design. Do not tune CTA v1 after observing its rejection.

## Non-negotiable state

- Product purpose: decide `reject`, `revise`, or `continue research`; never imply validated profit.
- Default project benchmark: Passive ETF-12 v1; every new protocol audits suitability; SPY and cash remain references.
- CTA v1: rejected under its locked protocol; this does not reject trend following generally.
- Execution: signal on completed close `N`, fill at next available open `N+1`.
- Watchlists: user-selected symbols persist per strategy and show lifecycle state.
- Candidate tabs: full-universe new-entry candidates per model, plus intersections; they are not watchlists.
- Data refresh and strategy runs are explicit actions, not navigation side effects.
- Macro series are non-tradable context under [ADR 0006](adr/0006-macro-data-contract.md); they never generate candidates until point-in-time data and a preregistered hypothesis exist.
- Cron, paper/live trading, brokers, and AWS remain out of scope.

## Resume sequence

1. Confirm `git status`, current version, and tests.
2. Read this checkpoint, then [product identity](identity.md), then the document for the active stage.
3. Preserve locked contracts unless creating a versioned ADR/protocol amendment.
4. Implement one bounded stage slice; update tests, roadmap, checkpoint, and changelog together.
5. Record research evidence as immutable results, not rewritten narrative.
