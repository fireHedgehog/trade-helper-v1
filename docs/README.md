# Documentation and resume checkpoint

This file is the authoritative entry point for a new agent or work session. Do not infer current work from the changelog.

## Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `0.33.0` |
| Parent release | `0.32.0` (durable Data Management refresh state) |
| Current state | Stage 8C feature slices complete; asynchronous browser coverage remains before the gate closes |
| Verification | `198 passed` plus headless Playwright workflow checks |
| Completed | Stage 8A state foundation; Stage 8B visual system and Today command centre |
| Next product work | Complete Stage 8C asynchronous browser coverage and close the productisation gate |
| Parked research | Stage 9A: acceptance standard and candidate priority; then 9B locked experiment |
| Parked operations | Stage 10 cron; Stage 11 deployment |

The application has the Stage 8B Today command centre plus Stage 8C improvements across Symbol Research, research metadata, Strategy Lab, Data Management, and Macro. Version 0.33.0 implements ADR 0006’s display boundary: the UI distinguishes Yahoo market context from final-revised FRED observations, labels unavailable release/vintage/forecast history, and removes causal equity-direction and regime claims. Macro remains display-only and cannot generate candidates. The ALFRED/release-history upgrade path is not implemented. Stage 8C still requires systematic asynchronous browser-state coverage before its gate closes.

Heavy statistical work is intentionally paused. On resumption, first operationalize candidate theses, audit benchmark/universe suitability, and only then apply the model acceptance scorecard. Read the protocol, CTA result, audit, and backlog before experiment design. Do not tune CTA v1 after observing its rejection.

## Non-negotiable state

- Product purpose: decide `reject`, `revise`, or `continue research`; never imply validated profit.
- Default project benchmark: Passive ETF-12 v1; every new protocol audits suitability; SPY and cash remain references.
- CTA v1: rejected under its locked protocol; this does not reject trend following generally.
- Execution: signal on completed close `N`, fill at next available open `N+1`.
- Watchlists: user-selected symbols persist per strategy and show lifecycle state.
- Candidate tabs: full-universe new-entry candidates per model, plus intersections; they are not watchlists.
- Data refresh and strategy runs are explicit actions, not navigation side effects.
- Macro series are non-tradable context under [ADR 0006](adr/0006-macro-data-contract.md); they never generate candidates until point-in-time data and a preregistered hypothesis exist.
- Cron, paper/live trading, brokers, and AWS remain out of scope.

## Resume sequence

1. Confirm `git status`, current version, and tests.
2. Read this checkpoint, then [product identity](identity.md), then the document for the active stage.
3. Preserve locked contracts unless creating a versioned ADR/protocol amendment.
4. Implement one bounded stage slice; update tests, roadmap, checkpoint, and changelog together.
5. Record research evidence as immutable results, not rewritten narrative.
