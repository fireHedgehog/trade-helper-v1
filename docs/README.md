# Documentation and resume checkpoint

This file is the authoritative entry point for a new agent or work session. Do not infer current work from the changelog.

## Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `0.40.0` |
| Parent release | `0.37.0` (first Stage 8 acceptance candidate) |
| Current state | Stage 9A Cycle 1 closed `not_evaluable`; no outcome evidence was produced |
| Verification | `222 passed`; 274 events, 6/8 retained variants, matching 0/274, byte-identical structural rerun |
| Completed | Stage 8; Stage 9A Cycle 1 selection, preregistration, detector, prevalence, and matching feasibility |
| Next product work | Start Cycle 2 candidate selection; do not relax Cycle 1 matching retrospectively |
| Active research | Stage 9A Cycle 2 selection; Stage 9B remains gated |
| Parked operations | Stage 10 cron; Stage 11 deployment |

The first real `0.37.0` acceptance run correctly ended `complete_with_errors`, but revealed two contract defects: settlement-based Yahoo futures were treated as equity candles, and a small invalid subset blocked every full-universe daily scan. Version `0.37.1` separates market context from the strategy universe, keeps equity validation strict, gives context bars an honest settlement contract, and permits daily discovery above a visible 90% coverage floor. The repaired real run then completed with zero failed/blocked model jobs: five new and two reused full-universe snapshots; empty watchlist scopes were honestly skipped. Saved snapshots retain exact exclusions and fingerprints. Formal experiments remain governed by their locked coverage rules.

Local-optimum guard: Stage 8 is closed. Do not add more infrastructure or UX polish unless a concrete defect blocks research. Cycle 1 is closed `not_evaluable`; the next work is a new Cycle 2 selection, not a repair chosen after seeing Cycle 1 counts.

Heavy statistical work is intentionally paused. On resumption, first operationalize candidate theses, audit benchmark/universe suitability, and only then apply the model acceptance scorecard. Read the protocol, CTA result, audit, and backlog before experiment design. Do not tune CTA v1 after observing its rejection.

## Non-negotiable state

- Product purpose: decide `reject`, `revise`, or `continue research`; never imply validated profit.
- Default project benchmark: Passive ETF-12 v1; every new protocol audits suitability; SPY and cash remain references.
- CTA v1: rejected under its locked protocol; this does not reject trend following generally.
- Execution: signal on completed close `N`, fill at next available open `N+1`.
- Watchlists: user-selected symbols persist per strategy and show lifecycle state.
- Candidate tabs: full-universe new-entry candidates per model, plus intersections; they are not watchlists.
- Data refresh and strategy runs are explicit actions, not navigation side effects.
- Macro series are non-tradable context under [ADR 0006](adr/0006-macro-data-contract.md); they never generate candidates until point-in-time data and a preregistered hypothesis exist.
- Cron, paper/live trading, brokers, and AWS remain out of scope.

## Resume sequence

1. Confirm `git status`, current version, and tests.
2. Read this checkpoint, then [product identity](identity.md), then the document for the active stage.
3. Preserve locked contracts unless creating a versioned ADR/protocol amendment.
4. Implement one bounded stage slice; update tests, roadmap, checkpoint, and changelog together.
5. Record research evidence as immutable results, not rewritten narrative.
