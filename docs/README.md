# Documentation and resume checkpoint

This file is the authoritative entry point for a new agent or work session. Do not infer current work from the changelog.

## Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `0.36.0` |
| Parent release | `0.34.0` (Stage 8C gate closure) |
| Current state | Stage 8D executor complete; bounded usability/layout exit work remains |
| Verification | `207 passed` plus live Playwright preview with zero console errors; execution deliberately not triggered |
| Completed | Stage 8A state foundation; Stage 8B visual system and Today command centre |
| Next product work | Stage 8D exit: narrow-layout and task-based ambiguity check, then stop product infrastructure |
| Parked research | Stage 9A: acceptance standard and candidate priority; then 9B locked experiment |
| Parked operations | Stage 10 cron; Stage 11 deployment |

Version 0.36.0 completes the bounded executor slice. Today first previews the deterministic plan; only explicit confirmation starts work. The durable job refreshes dependencies, re-plans after publication (including partial failures), runs independent changed snapshots through the same path as manual actions, and stores every outcome in SQLite. Restart marks unfinished work interrupted. Retry creates a new plan, so current data and matching snapshots are skipped. Navigation remains read-only and cron remains parked.

Local-optimum guard: Stage 8D ends after narrow-layout, task-usability, and browser-regression checks. Do not expand infrastructure or polish a “beautiful toy.” The next substantive gate is Stage 9A candidate priority and preregistered acceptance design; automation cannot turn rejected or unevaluated strategies into evidence.

Heavy statistical work is intentionally paused. On resumption, first operationalize candidate theses, audit benchmark/universe suitability, and only then apply the model acceptance scorecard. Read the protocol, CTA result, audit, and backlog before experiment design. Do not tune CTA v1 after observing its rejection.

## Non-negotiable state

- Product purpose: decide `reject`, `revise`, or `continue research`; never imply validated profit.
- Default project benchmark: Passive ETF-12 v1; every new protocol audits suitability; SPY and cash remain references.
- CTA v1: rejected under its locked protocol; this does not reject trend following generally.
- Execution: signal on completed close `N`, fill at next available open `N+1`.
- Watchlists: user-selected symbols persist per strategy and show lifecycle state.
- Candidate tabs: full-universe new-entry candidates per model, plus intersections; they are not watchlists.
- Data refresh and strategy runs are explicit actions, not navigation side effects.
- Macro series are non-tradable context under [ADR 0006](adr/0006-macro-data-contract.md); they never generate candidates until point-in-time data and a preregistered hypothesis exist.
- Cron, paper/live trading, brokers, and AWS remain out of scope.

## Resume sequence

1. Confirm `git status`, current version, and tests.
2. Read this checkpoint, then [product identity](identity.md), then the document for the active stage.
3. Preserve locked contracts unless creating a versioned ADR/protocol amendment.
4. Implement one bounded stage slice; update tests, roadmap, checkpoint, and changelog together.
5. Record research evidence as immutable results, not rewritten narrative.
