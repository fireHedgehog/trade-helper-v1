# Documentation and resume checkpoint

This file is the authoritative entry point for a new agent or work session. Do not infer current work from the changelog.

## Checkpoint

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | `0.43.0` |
| Parent release | `0.37.0` (first Stage 8 acceptance candidate) |
| Current state | Stage 9A Cycle 2 closed and its chosen protocol locked: [SMA Cross v1 exposure-reduction, jointly against a volatility-state placebo](research-protocols/sma-cross-v1-exposure-reduction.md), specification SHA-256 `5bee965b775645681149049e3ecf43a618b4e71b225bc97b53b88b62b6ebf4ae`; no data fetched or inspected under it yet |
| Verification | `222 passed` at `0.40.0`; `0.43.0` added no runtime code, only a locked spec and docs |
| Completed | Stage 8; Stage 9A Cycle 1 selection through matching feasibility; Stage 9A Cycle 2 candidate scoring/verification and protocol lock for Candidate A/B |
| Next product work | Fetch the 12-ETF universe on the executing machine, record the spec's data fingerprint, implement the state-recomputing bootstrap extension in `research.py` per the protocol's lock checklist, then run |
| Active research | Stage 9A Cycle 2 execution (not yet started); CTA v2 and cross-sectional rotation remain parked pending infrastructure; Stage 9B remains gated |
| Parked operations | Stage 10 cron; Stage 11 deployment; CTA v2 and cross-sectional rotation pending a pooled-portfolio engine and panel/permutation tooling respectively |
| Pending triage | 2026-08-19 methodology/implementation audit (2 critical, 2 high, 5 medium, 4 low), untriaged; see [audits/README.md](audits/README.md) |

The first real `0.37.0` acceptance run correctly ended `complete_with_errors`, but revealed two contract defects: settlement-based Yahoo futures were treated as equity candles, and a small invalid subset blocked every full-universe daily scan. Version `0.37.1` separates market context from the strategy universe, keeps equity validation strict, gives context bars an honest settlement contract, and permits daily discovery above a visible 90% coverage floor. The repaired real run then completed with zero failed/blocked model jobs: five new and two reused full-universe snapshots; empty watchlist scopes were honestly skipped. Saved snapshots retain exact exclusions and fingerprints. Formal experiments remain governed by their locked coverage rules.

Local-optimum guard: Stage 8 is closed. Do not add more infrastructure or UX polish unless a concrete defect blocks research. Cycle 1 is closed `not_evaluable`; Cycle 2 selection and protocol lock are both closed. The next work is fetching data and implementing the one bounded bootstrap extension the locked protocol names, then running it — not scoring a sixth candidate, not building the pooled-portfolio engine that would unblock the parked candidates (a future, separately justified deliverable), and not widening the SMA window grid before this run's result is seen.

Heavy statistical work is intentionally paused. On resumption, first operationalize candidate theses, audit benchmark/universe suitability, and only then apply the model acceptance scorecard. Read the protocol, CTA result, audit, and backlog before experiment design. Do not tune CTA v1 after observing its rejection.

## Non-negotiable state

- Product purpose: decide `reject`, `revise`, or `continue research`; never imply validated profit.
- Default project benchmark: Passive ETF-12 v1; every new protocol audits suitability; SPY and cash remain references.
- CTA v1: rejected under its locked protocol; this does not reject trend following generally.
- Execution: signal on completed close `N`, fill at next available open `N+1`.
- Watchlists: user-selected symbols persist per strategy and show lifecycle state.
- Candidate tabs: full-universe new-entry candidates per model, plus intersections; they are not watchlists.
- Data refresh and strategy runs are explicit actions, not navigation side effects.
- Macro series are non-tradable context under [ADR 0006](adr/0006-macro-data-contract.md); they never generate candidates until point-in-time data and a preregistered hypothesis exist.
- Cron, paper/live trading, brokers, and AWS remain out of scope.

## Environment and data portability

`data/` and `.venv/` are git-ignored ([data/README.md](../data/README.md)); Git carries specifications, code, and immutable evidence, never the local database or interpreter. A checkout without both populated can read, edit, and plan documentation and specifications, and can run any test that does not require `data/market.db` rows; it cannot run the server or any detector/matching/experiment runner against real data.

A locked specification's data fingerprint (for example `consolidation-support-feasibility-v1`'s `development_sha256`) is computed over the exact rows in `data/market.db` at lock time. Re-fetching is not a substitute: Yahoo `auto_adjust=True` rebases full price history on every dividend, so a fresh `python -m app.fetch` run is not guaranteed to reproduce a prior fingerprint, and `run_consolidation_feasibility.py` raises `RuntimeError` on any mismatch rather than proceeding on unverified data. To move locked-data execution to another machine, copy the `data/market.db` file itself; do not re-fetch and expect an identical hash.

Consequence for new locked work (Stage 9A Cycle 2 or later): candidate selection, scorecard, and protocol drafting need no data. Locking a specification's data fingerprint and running its detector must happen on the machine holding the intended `data/market.db`; that machine then becomes the only one able to execute that specification until the database file is copied across.

On a checkout with no `data/market.db` rows, `pytest -q` fails exactly two tests, not zero: `test_consolidation_feasibility.py::test_real_locked_spec_and_development_data_reproduce` (fingerprint mismatch against an empty database) and `test_api.py::test_signal_rejects_unknown_parameter` (`/api/signal/SPY` returns `404` before parameter validation because `SPY` is not stored). Both are the expected empty-database state, confirmed by direct run at `0.41.0`, not a regression to fix.

## Resume sequence

1. Confirm `git status`, current version, and tests.
2. Read this checkpoint, then [product identity](identity.md), then the document for the active stage.
3. Preserve locked contracts unless creating a versioned ADR/protocol amendment.
4. Implement one bounded stage slice; update tests, roadmap, checkpoint, and changelog together.
5. Record research evidence as immutable results, not rewritten narrative.
